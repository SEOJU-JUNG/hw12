# Catch butterfly 

You are trying to catch a butterfly, and if the butterfly sits down on the flower, you win. I will replace the circle to a butterfly png. 

## Summary

The butterfly is flying around the canvas, and with your mouse, you are trying to catch it, but once you catch it, it goes to a random place, and if it sits down on the flower that is randomly distributed, you win. 


## Component Parts

I will do some illustration to make a butterfly and flower image and illustraot image file and p5 code are inputs/outputs that I am using. 

Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use. You can also upload an image with a diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.

## When your project is completed, you will then add the following sections:
